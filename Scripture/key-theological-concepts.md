# Key Theological concepts.

These are the key theological concepts of the religion _name-to-be-decided_.

They are based on an idea, that " humans are not in a superior role when compared to the rest of the universe"

## 1. Interconnectedness
**Belief**: Everything in the universe is interconnected, forming a vast, interdependent network.

**Implication**: Human actions have consequences that ripple through this network, affecting the environment, other species, and cosmic processes.

## 2. Humility and Reverence
**Belief:** Humans must approach the universe with humility and reverence, recognizing their small role in the grand scheme.

**Implication:** This leads to a respect for all forms of life and natural phenomena, emphasizing conservation, respect, and awe.

## 3. Cosmic Purpose
**Belief:** Humanity’s purpose is to contribute to the harmony of the universe, rather than dominating it.

**Implication:** Each person's life goal is to find ways to live harmoniously within this larger context, whether through science, spirituality, or ethics.

## 4. Continual Learning and Adaptation
**Belief:** The universe is constantly changing and evolving, and humans must adapt their understanding and behavior accordingly.

**Implication:** This religion could promote ongoing education, scientific inquiry, and spiritual exploration as forms of worship.

## 5. The Sacredness of All Existence
**Belief:** All components of the universe—whether living beings, stars, or planets—are inherently sacred.

**Implication:** This sacredness demands a kind of universal ethics where the rights of planets and galaxies are considered alongside the rights of humans and animals.

## 6. Stewardship, Not Dominion
**Belief:** Humans are caretakers or stewards of their immediate environment and the universe at large, rather than rulers.

**Implication:** Environmentalism and sustainability become spiritual duties.

## 7. Unity and Diversity
**Belief:** The diversity within the universe—from galaxies to ecosystems—is a source of strength and beauty.

**Implication:** Cultural, biological, and cosmic diversity is to be celebrated, and unity is sought through appreciation and understanding of differences.

## 8. Existential Equality
**Belief:** All entities, regardless of their scale or complexity, have an equal right to exist and flourish.

**Implication:** This could lead to a radical form of democracy where the needs of non-human entities are considered alongside human needs in decision-making processes.
