This a small hobby project, in which I am trying to create a new religion.

Creation project heavily utilizes ChatGPT 4 by OpenAI. Used prompts and edits to ChatGPT output are based on my naive world view.

None of this is to be taken too seriously and is not meant as an isult againts to any other exististing religion or world view.

## Commercial utilization.
I discourage anyone from utilizing the religion described in this repository for commercial purposes. If you decide to do so, at least read through the key theological concepts, and practice the Principal of Universal Responsibility by medidating on the idea for at least three 30 minute sessions and discuss the idea with four persons you don't know in advance.
